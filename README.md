# MyReads Project

## About Project

This app was built for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program. It has been a great project to learn the basics of React app development. It was a challenge getting started with this project as React is the first JavaScript library I have begun to learn. I used another students project as a basis to get started. Below is the link to the repository

https://github.com/sarah-maris/reactnd-project-myreads.git

I have learned a good amount about React from this project and look forward to applying these skills to some projects of my own.

## How to install and run the app

This project makes use of Node.js and Facebook's Create-React-App. Install Node.js first if it is not already installed https://nodejs.org

After Node has been installed clone this project in the directory/folder of your choice

git clone https://github.com/ARogala/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git

Once the project has been cloned navigate the terminal into the projects root folder and install

npm install

After all the dependencies have been installed launch the app

npm start

Facebook's Create-React-App will launch the app in your default browser at localhost port 3000

I used https://github.com/sarah-maris/reactnd-project-myreads as a basis for this project. I added this to my sources and cited as necessary. I feel my code is unique enough to be my own. However, some implementation details are similar and one method in App.js is the same (I cited this in the comments). Please let me know if you feel anything else needs to be changed or cited. I did my best to keep this project original but that is a challenge as there is only so many ways to do things.
